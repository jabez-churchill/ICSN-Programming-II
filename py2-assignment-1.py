This is a multi-line comment block.
Everything we write inside of the triple quotes is a comment, 
effecting nothing in our program.

Below are some typical comment tags for you to use.

#_______________No Action Required________________________
# HACK tells us that part of a code is a "bad solution", or messy, and should be improved.
# XXX shows us something needs attention, or is important to know.
# NOTE shows us some detail, not super important.
# UNDONE tells us something was changed back, after a change.

#_______________Action Required________________________
# BUG  is a comment tag that shows where there is a bug.
# FIXME shows us something is broken.
# TODO is a comment tag that shows (others, or reminds yourself) that you need to finish something.
# TODO(2) adds a number to the comment tag for organization... for priority scale or numbered tasks.
