# Letzgo. Open your file, you should already have some lists.
# How do you work with Lists if they're all different lengths?

# TODO(0): Get familiar with functions: len() and str().
# LEN. Let's use len() to return the size of each List.
# CASTING. To ensure that our return value is the Data Type what we need (a string).


# TODO(1): Make a "helper function" that TAKES one list, and RETURNS a value using a random index position.
    # Get a random number, make sure it's a legal index number by using len()
    # Get a random list value (string)
    # Return the value, but cast it as a string.

# Test: Print your function, pass in a list.


# TODO(2): Declare your main function that Returns a new random car configuration.
        # Grab a random value for each category using your Helper Function.
        # Declare a string, build your output sentence.
        # Return the completed string.


# Test by printing your new main Function.
